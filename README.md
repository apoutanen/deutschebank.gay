Please make a branch for your contributions and only merge it into main when necessary. You should make a directory with your name and put your webpage source in there. Link to your pages from the root `index.html`. Feel free to spice up the root index as well if you want, but merging those changes will be up to you.

If you have any questions about or need help with git you can ask Aria, Hugo, or Jeff.
