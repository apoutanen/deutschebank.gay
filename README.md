# contributing

Please make a branch for your contributions and only merge it into main when necessary. You should make a directory with your name and put your webpage source in there. Link to your pages from the root `index.html`. Feel free to spice up the root index as well if you want, but merging those changes will be up to you.

If you have any questions about or need help with git you can ask Aria, Hugo, or Jeff.

# how to write html + css

HMTL is a way to define blocks and containers on a page that can be styled to look however you want! It may seem daunting at first but it starts to make sense once you get into it.

Make a new folder with your name and add a file to it called `yourname.html`.
Your file needs to have the default HTML attributes:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>BYRON'S BIRTHDAY WEBSITE</title>
</head>
<body>
	welcome to aria's page
</body>
</html>
```
HTML open and closing tag, a header, and a body.

Now, grab the //location// of this file and load it in your browser, ie :`/Users/aria/Documents/Projects/deutschebank.gay/aria/aria.html`. Your text editor might have something that does this for you - Sublime Text has `Copy File Path` on right click. Paste this file location into your browser and you should be able to see your rendered HTML file! 
Everytime you make a change save the file and reload your browser, you should see your change there!
